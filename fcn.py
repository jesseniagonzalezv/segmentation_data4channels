    Module wrapper that returns intermediate layers from a model
    It has a strong assumption that the modules have been registered

    This means that one should **not** reuse the same nn.Module
    twice in the forward if you want this to work.
    Additionally, it is only able to query submodules that are directly
    assigned to the model. So if `model` is passed, `model.feature1` can
    be returned, but not `model.feature1.layer2`.

        model (nn.Module): model on which we will extract the features

            of the modules for which the activations will be returned as
            the key of the dict, and the value of the dict is the name
            of the returned activation (which the user can specify).
    Examples::
        >>> m = torchvision.models.resnet18(pretrained=True)
